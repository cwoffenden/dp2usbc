DisplayPort to USB-C Carrier
============================

This project allows USB-C monitors to be connected via DisplayPort. Specifically, this was to connect a Mac [External Graphics Development Kit](https://developer.apple.com/development-kit/external-graphics/) to the USB-C only [LG Ultrafine 4k](https://www.lg.com/us/monitors/lg-22MD4KA-B-4k-uhd-led-monitor), but should work with other eGPU and monitor configurations.

Various designs of this have been in use since September 2017, initially with a single Ultrafine, but now running a multi-monitor setup for times when only 12'288 horizontal pixels will do! It works with both macOS and Windows running on the same machine (under Boot Camp).
